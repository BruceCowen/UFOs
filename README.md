# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview of Project
In this project we created a javascript file to search the data given and produced a webpage to filter that data based on a users input. This data described different UFO sightings throughout the U.S.
## Results
This webpage allows the user to filter the data on five different criteria. These criteria are the date, city, state, country and shape of sighting. When put into the search the user can check the sightings for any of these criteria.

## Summary
Although people can search our data with the html file we created one flaw is that it does not update automitcally and users cannot see if someone else sighted something recently. The user can use this webpage to find different sightings that have already happened but it is limited. Also there is no validation method for these claims so some of these might be false.
